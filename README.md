# Sanctions Explorer

[Sanctions Explorer](https://sanctionsexplorer.web.app) is my version of [C4ADS's Sanction Explorer](https://sanctionsexplorer.org) built with React, a Google Firestore NoSQL database, and Algolia search. The search page works similarly to C4ADS's Sanction Explorer, but this version is not fully featured yet and does not yet pull from all of the data sources that C4ADS pulls from. The subset of OFAC active sanctions that is displayed in Sanctions Explorer was pulled from OFAC SDN XML file on June 19th, 2021.
